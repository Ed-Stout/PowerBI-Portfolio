# PowerBI-Portfolio
Links to short projects I have worked on which demonstrate my Power BI capabilities.

The data is taken from the following places:
1. COVID-19 dashboard: "https://dashboard.cowin.gov.in/" and "https://www.mygov.in/covid-19/"
2. Supermarket dashboard: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales"
3. Video Games dashboard: "https://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/"

I have tried to utilise a variety of different tools to demonstrate the diversity of my PowerBI skills.
